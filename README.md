## Conditional Statements

### Logical Condtions

* Equals: `a == b`
* Not equals: `a != b`
* Less than: `a < b`
* Less than or equal to: `a <= b`
* Greater than: `a > b`
* Greater than or equals: `a >= b`

**Note:** The `=` is an assignment operator while `==` is for comparison.


### If statement syntax
```python
if condition:
    #code when true


if condition:
    # code when true
else:
    # code when false

if condition1:
    # code when condition1 is true
elif condition2:
    # code when condition2 is true
```
